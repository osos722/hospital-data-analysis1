This is a data analysis project that aims to analyze hospital appointment data from Brazil and identify the key factors behind patients not attending their scheduled appointments (no-show).
The project explores attendance percentages and investigates the impact of various factors such as gender, age, alcoholism, chronic diseases, and waiting time on appointment attendance.
The insights are presented through data analysis, visualizations, and dashboards to support data-driven decision making in healthcare.
